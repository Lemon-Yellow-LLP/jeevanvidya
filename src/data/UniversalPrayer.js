    universalPrayer: `The essence of Jeevanvidya Philosophy is the Universal Prayer. It is a succinct, beautiful, and profound poetry which, when uttered, creates an aura of vibrations that impacts an individual, a family, a society, a country, and finally the world at large.
    The Universal Prayer explores three essential values of humanity - being interdependent, interconnected, and interrelated. Its universality comes from the lack of focus on any particular age, caste, creed, color, or nationality. It promotes only one thing: betterment of humanity as whole.
    Every word is scientific, logical, and practical in its existence. Woven together, it is a sacrosanct chant of well-being adaptable and beneficial for the world. The far-reaching nature of the Universal Prayer aims to create a deep-rooted and impactful influence of positive thoughts for harmonious results, across the world. `,
    content: `The cosmic essence of the Prayer:
    Interdependence is the crux of our existence. Our lives are led by the contribution of many people’s lives. Prayer makes you understand the freedom of this dependency, allowing you to co-exist harmoniously with everything and everyone around you.
    Mind metamorphoses into matter with sheer force of will. Our interconnection through evolution makes us receptive to change. When you change your thoughts and patterns for the positive towards people and things,  they change for you in equal measures. 
    In the end, our interrelation to each other creates a chain reaction. This keeps positivity and harmony flowing and growing from an individual, to a family, to a society, to a nation, and at large to the world. `,

    text: `
    The ‘Universal Prayer’ includes all important needs of a human being. It includes material progress (health, wealth, wisdom) and spiritual progress (devotion to God). Hence it is comprehensive and compact.
When I ask for ‘everyone’, I expand my consciousness and gradually coincide it with the Infinite Cosmic Life Force. This helps to achieve enlightenment.
The Universal Prayer simultaneously invokes the unmanifest Cosmic Life Force and the manifest Universe. Hence the person worships both aspects of the Cosmic Life Force. Very few prayers achieve this goal.
The ancient scriptures have references about asking for the ‘good of all’. Unfortunately, this knowledge was forgotten and not explained. 
Modern quantum mechanics has proved that both thought and matter are two different forms of energy; and that one can be converted into another.

    description: `From time immemorial, human beings are advised to meditate on the ‘Name of God’ to solve all their problems. However it is quite difficult, or almost impossible, due to a variety of reasons. The ‘Universal Prayer’ solves this problem and yet achieves the results, as the practitioner can understand and visualise what he says. Since the ‘Universal Prayer’ asks for the ‘good of all’ and since ‘all’ can be seen and understood, the practitioner is anchored to the ‘Universal Prayer’.
    Advanced practitioners can gradually expand the circle of ‘all’ in the ‘Universal Prayer’ and include all human beings, animals, birds, trees, and non-living things such as earth, water, fire, air, sky, etc. As he does this, he gets a favourable response from each of these elements.
    James Allen, a famous philosopher, said ‘as you change your thoughts towards things and people, the things and people will change towards you’. In the ‘Universal Prayer’, the practitioner sends out positive vibrations towards one and all and hence gets back a favourable response from the entire universe.`,
