    whatIsUniversalPrayer: `The essence of Jeevanvidya Philosophy is the Universal Prayer. It is a succinct, beautiful, and profound poetry which, when uttered, creates an aura of vibrations that impacts an individual, a family, a society, a country, and finally the world at large.
    The Universal Prayer explores three essential values of humanity - being interdependent, interconnected, and interrelated. Its universality comes from the lack of focus on any particular age, caste, creed, color, or nationality. It promotes only one thing: betterment of humanity as whole.
    Every word is scientific, logical, and practical in its existence. Woven together, it is a sacrosanct chant of well-being adaptable and beneficial for the world. The far-reaching nature of the Universal Prayer aims to create a deep-rooted and impactful influence of positive thoughts for harmonious results, across the world. `,
